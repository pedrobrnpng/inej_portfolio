I am an **animator** and artist from _Porto, Portugal_.

I have completed a degree in **BA (Hons) Animation** under the guidance of animation directors **Jonathan Hodgson** and **Osbert Parker**.

I make **2D animations**, sometimes digital but I also love working on paper with charcoal, inks and paint.

In my **digital work**, I enjoy working with limited and **bold** colour palettes and focus on achieving natural and fluid movements in my animation. When working analogue, I work on a single piece of paper where I animate straight ahead and shoot each frame under a rostrum camera as I go along. I find that this approach allows me to be more creative and forces me to embrace any mistake I might make during production.

I am fascinated by the human psyche and love reading and analysing poetry. I also like working on silly narratives that sometimes verge on the surreal.
